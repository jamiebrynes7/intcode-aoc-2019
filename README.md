# Advent of Code 2019 - Intcode Machine

This code sample was taken from my solutions to the [2019 edition of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). This library grew and evolved features across multiple questions to solve the increasingly complex questions. You can find a brief description of this machine [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Intcode).
